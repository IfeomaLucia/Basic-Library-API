# Basic-Library-API

# Description
This is a basic Library API which allows the user to add books, delete books, update books etc to the library

# How to run
Running a program like this requires an application such as the Advanced REST Client(this is a Chrome extension package and it is free to download).
Inside this application you can then specify the methods(such as the GET, POST, DELETE etc) and the respective links(such as the '/api/addBook')
